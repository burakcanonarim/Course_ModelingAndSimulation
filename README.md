# **Course:** Modeling and Simulation
This repository is about a lecture which is named "Modeling and Simulation" at Mugla Sitki Kocman University. This project made using Arena Simulation version 16.10.00000.12938-528 with student licence.


In this project, we've simulate an imaginary airport system which has 3 control points. These are designed like 2-level security property. To be more precise, I can explain with a scenario.

The passenger enters to the airport and go trough the line to check for security. The process of checking is randomly either manual or automatically. This is absolutely choise randomly with some statistical probability distributions(e.g., Uniform, Poisson, etc.). Then this passenger go for another control point and its name is police control point. This is a mandatory, so there is no chance of passengers to be not controlled. After the all controls, the passengers go out from airport.

PS: Some passengers cannot controlled, we named them "overlooked passengers".
